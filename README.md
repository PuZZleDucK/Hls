# Haskell clone of coreutils #

This has turned into a vain attempt to recreate the GNU coreutils programs in Haskell, for no particular reason... Maybe someday some student called Hlinus will write a kernel and this will then come in handy.

### Now with bonus: Hlolcat ###

## Continuious Integration

[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/puzzleduck/hls/branches/master/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/puzzleduck/hls)

App is hosted on semaphore which sets up Haskell and attempts to run demo program.

## Progress so far: ##

### Done: ###
* lolcat ==> Hlolcat (fully functional)
* yes ==> Hyes (works, updated)
* whoami ==> Hwhoami (done, update needed)
* basename ==> Hbasename (done, update needed)
* ls ==> Hls (work in progress, needs to work on real IO, colors, formats..., update needed)
* uniq ==> Huniq (Started, lots to do, almost all, need repl loop, update needed)
* echo ==> Hecho (mostly working, update needed)
* true / false ==> Htrue / Hfalse (skeleton, update needed)
* seq ==> Hseq (basic functionality working, update needed)
* cat ==> Hcat (multiple files and seperators working, update needed)
* head ==> Hhead (line count, update needed)
* printenv ==> Hprintenv (update needed)
* pwd ==> Hpwd (Started, but will need redo, update needed)
* sort ==> Hsort (Options and text, update needed)
* touch ==> Htouch (Options and text, update needed)
* shuf ==> Hshuf (Started, argument redo, messy, update needed)
* truncate ==> Htruncate (Options with params trial, update needed)
* sleep ==> sleep (works, but not accurate time, update needed)
* rmdir ==> Hrmdir (basic deleting works, not all flags obeyed, update needed)
* mkdir ==> Hmkdir (basic making works, " " " ", update needed)

### ToDo - Interesting: ###
* users ==> skeleton
* tr
* shred
* printf (prereq for many others)
* mkfifo / mknod / mktemp
* md5sum / cksum / sum
* link / ln / unlink
* kill
* env
* dd
* df
* chroot
* date

### ToDo - Easy: ###
* uptime / groups / hostid / hostname
* uname / uname-arch / uname-uname
* tail
* split
* rm / mv / cp / chgrp / chmod / chown
* nice
* du
* wc (prototype done)

### Hard - Have other prerequisites: ###
* tee
* stty
* stat
* stdbuf

* tty
* test
* timeout
